# Tailwind CSS Playground

Official Sandbox template repository, [tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-playground](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-playground) has been arhived as it was using Taiwlind CSS v1.x

This template uses Tailwind CSS v2.x

## JIT Mode

You can enable [Just-in-Time](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode#enabling-jit-mode) ("JIT") mode in `tailwind.config.js` but I couldn't get it working stably.
